# FSA validator
There is a small Finite State Automata (FSA) validator.

I wrote it because it was my homework. I think that this script can be useful.

### Usage

Example input can be found in `fsa.txt`. Program prints the answer to the `result.txt`.

Be sure to check if "the syntax" of input is correct. Honestly, the script does not check all possible cases of input.
